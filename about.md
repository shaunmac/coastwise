**Richard** is a pilot, engineer, mechanic, sailor and farmer with an organic  farm in the Buller Valley. He now lives in Greymouth. His daughter, a farrier, and son, a professional sailor manage the  family farm. His wife is a District Nurse.

Richard was born on a small beef farm in West Sussex and left school at 16, completing an apprenticeship in aircraft engineering  at London Gatwick in 1984.  Working on every continent he became an Airline Pilot  and Licenced Engineer and flew and maintained Boeing 707 and DC10 airliners until emigrating to NZ in 2003.

After flying tourists around Queenstown for a year Richard and his family moved to the Top of the South and into the voluntary and political arena as the reasons for our societal failures became more evident.

He is dedicated to justice, equality, sustainability and the realisation of true human potential.

A Nelson Mayoral candidate in 2013 and 2016, Richard is also the founder and leader of the New Zealand Money Free Party, which contested both the 2014 and 2017 general elections.
