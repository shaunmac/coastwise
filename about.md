**Richard** is an instructor, pilot, engineer, mechanic, sailor, mountaineer and farmer with an organic farm in the Buller Valley. His daughter, a farrier and Neuroscience undergraduate, and son, a professional sailor and pilot manage the family farm. His wife is a District Nurse.

Richard was born on a farm in West Sussex and left school at 16, completing an apprenticeship in aircraft engineering at London Gatwick in 1984.  Working on every continent he became an Airline Pilot  and Licenced Engineer and flew and maintained Boeing 707 and DC10 airliners until emigrating to NZ in 2003.

After flying tourists around Queenstown Richard and his family moved to the Top of the South and into the voluntary and political arena as the reasons for our societal failures became more evident.

He is dedicated to justice, equality, sustainability and the realisation of true human potential.

A Nelson Mayoral candidate in 2013 and 2016, and in Grey District in 2019, Richard is also the founder and leader of the New Zealand Money Free Party, which contested the 2014, 2017 and 2020 general elections. October 2022 sees Marlborough, Nelson, Tasman, Buller, Grey and Westland Districts as the next local government opportunity.
