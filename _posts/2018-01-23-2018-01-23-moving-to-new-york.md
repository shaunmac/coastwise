**Haven't we got some more options today?**

Do you think this is the best we can do?

It is the 21st Century after all.

We have solutions to all our challenges, but the money always gets in the way of them.

Then all our problems would become easy to solve.

Not only does money lie at the root of all our problems, it also prevents us from making any real progress.
