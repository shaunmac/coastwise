Marlborough has some deeply rooted problems. None of which can be solved within the money market system. The results of that are only too easy to see.

Marlborough has all the right attributes for an alternative option. And it is an option. We can choose whatever we want.

We all want basically the same things. Security, wellbeing, justice, equality, prosperity, sustainability etc. Nobody actually wants to destroy everything. The competitive money system ensures that we are all forced to fight, against our will and nature, to survive. And even that is getting constantly harder.

Human progress has provided us with the knowledge, the tools, the resources and the energy to provide a fair and fulfilling life for all. Freed entirely from debt, servitude, exploitation, stress, poverty and drudgery.

Marlborough's unique situation, abundant resources, resourceful, connected, innovative and educated people, at the centre of the world’s most advanced country, provides us with an unprecedented opportunity.

The question becomes, what is the purpose of organised human life ?

Is it to service an outdated, redundant and arbitrary ‘economic’ system ?

Or is it to take care of humankind and the planet ?

Because it is becoming increasingly obvious to those who care to look, that we are going to have to choose one or the other. And soon.

The combination of science, global understanding, sociology, psychology, technology and mechanisation provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to finally become what we know we are. Civilised human beings.

## **Resilience**

We ignore the wisdom of history at our peril.

We are rapidly becoming less resilient.

Our region is dominated by forces that may have different priorities.

Our infrastructure is ageing.

Our society is becoming more unequal, fragmented and stressed.

Our food is increasingly expensive and lacking in nutrition and taste.

Our health is suffering.

Our mental wellbeing is precarious.

Our capacity to function effectively after a major natural disaster is questionable.

## **Timeline & Implementation**

All changes start somewhere. Of course we can't rush things, the transition will take a little time. But change is very rapid today. Already the majority of the population of NZ is aware that something just isn’t right. Once the Win-Win nature of Resource Based Economics is widely recognised there will be no stopping its implementation. There are just too many benefits for all to ignore for much longer. Especially when considered against the Lose-Lose consequences of not adopting it.

The choice? 

Utopia or armageddon. 

Easy really.
