The Coast provided the gold to pay for the development of NZ.

The Coast provided the coal to power NZ.

The Coast provided the timber to build NZ.

More established centres without such a boom/bust history take longer to react to socioeconomic shifts. The Coast moves very fast.

We believe that in addition to leading the development of this country, and possibly the world, the Coast is now leading the next phase. And it’s currently not pretty.

Infrastructure breakdown, poverty, drugs, suicide and disempowerment indicate deeply rooted problems. None of which can be solved within the money market system. The results of that are only too easy to see.

Fortunately, the Coast, and Grey District in particular possess all the right attributes for the alternative option. And it is an option. We can choose whatever we want.

We all want the same thing. Security, wellbeing, justice, equality, prosperity, sustainability etc. Nobody actually wants to destroy everything. The competitive money system ensures that we are all forced to fight, against our will and nature, to survive. And even that is getting constantly harder.

Human progress has provided us with the knowledge, the tools, the resources and the energy to provide a fair and fulfilling life for all. Freed entirely from debt, servitude, exploitation, stress, poverty and drudgery.

The Coast’s unique situation, abundant resources, resourceful, connected, innovative and educated people, remote location and leading position in the socioeconomic evolution, physically detached from, and yet closely emotionally connected to possibly the world’s most advanced country, provides us with an utterly unprecedented opportunity.

The monetary system requires either wealthy people, to consume and feed growth, or natural resources to extract and exploit. As the Coast rapidly runs out of both, we can see an entire region being literally excluded from the rest of the country, the world in fact.

The question becomes, what is the purpose of organised human life ?

Is it to service an outdated, redundant and arbitrary ‘economic’ system ?

Or is it to take care of humankind and the planet ?

Because it is becoming increasingly obvious to those who care to look, that we are going to have to choose one or the other. And soon.

The combination of science, global understanding, sociology, psychology, technology and mechanisation provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to finally become what we know we are. Civilised human beings.

## **Resilience**

We ignore the wisdom of history at our peril.

We are rapidly becoming less resilient.

Our infrastructure is ageing.

Our society is becoming more fragmented and stressed.

Our food is increasingly expensive and lacking in nutrition and taste.

Our health is suffering.

Our mental wellbeing is precarious.

Our capacity to function effectively after a major natural disaster is questionable.

## **Timeline & Implementation**

All changes start somewhere. Of course we can't rush things, the transition will take a little time. But change is very rapid today. Already the majority of the population of NZ is aware that something just isn’t right. Once the Win-Win nature of Resource Based Economics is widely recognised there will be no stopping it’s implementation. There are just too many benefits for all to ignore for much longer. Especially when considered against the Lose-Lose consequences of not adopting it.

In the short term, as an obvious and much needed first step, Greymouth now has the capacity and opportunity to grow and distribute organic fruit and vegetables to the whole Coast region. Totally free, and delivered daily throughout.  Tai Poutini Polytech can lead and structure the project. Organic, industrial scale food production. Utilising the latest knowledge, respecting the indigenous wisdom of our predecessors. We already have free libraries, firefighting, ambulance, healthcare, welfare, pensions, water, air, parks, rivers and so on. There is absolutely no good reason that this trend cannot be continued and accelerated. Until everything is free. Provided by willing, fulfilled, supported volunteers, who, like us all, intrinsically yearn to share their skills and energies with a civilised, caring, responsible society.
