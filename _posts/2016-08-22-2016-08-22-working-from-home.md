## The situation

> The challenges we face today are unprecedented. We have never been in this situation before. We need an updated perspective. One that recognises the totally new scenario that is 2020.
>
> With vision, passion and energy, we must combine our courage, innovation and expertise to shape a future we can all be proud of.
>
> The time has come to embrace the situation and to look outside of conventional solutions with positivity and excitement. A complete and radical reassessment of our capabilities and opportunities.
>
> Recognising the difference that's now possible if we examine what we actually need. **And of course that does not include a competitive monetary system.**
>
> Thereâ€™s so much to look forward to.
>
> We have the tools and skills available to us to bring about massive positive change.
>
> Solving properly and sustainably our growing list of problems.
>
> Healthcare, poverty, crime, drugs, stress, infrastructure breakdown, climate change and pollution are readily solvable today. We know we have the necessary resources and technology. But we will need to approach these challenges in a different way now. This is the 21st century and we cannot use 19th century 'solutions' any more.
