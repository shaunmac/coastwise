## The situation

> The challenges we face today are unprecedented. We have never been in this situation before. We need an updated perspective. One that recognises the totally new situation that we are in in 2020.
>
>  With vision, passion and energy. We must combine our courage, innovation and expertise to shape a future we can all be proud of.
>
> The time has come to embrace the situation and to look outside of conventional solutions with positivity and excitement. A complete and radical reassessment of our capabilities and opportunities. 
>
> Recognising the difference that's now possible if we examine what we actually need. And of course that does not include a competitive monetary system.
>
> There’s so much to look forward to.
>
> We have the tools and skills available to us to bring about massive positive change.
>
> Solving properly and sustainably our growing list of problems.
>
> Healthcare, poverty, crime, drugs, stress, infrastructure breakdown, climate change and pollution are readily solvable today. We know we have the necessary resources and technology. But we will need to approach these challenges in a different way now. This is the 21st century and we cannot use 19th century 'solutions' any more.
