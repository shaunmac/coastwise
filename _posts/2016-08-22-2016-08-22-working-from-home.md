## The situation

> The challenges we face today are unprecedented. We have never been in this situation before. We need new leadership. With vision, passion and energy. We must combine our courage, innovation and expertise to shape a future we can all be proud of.
>
> The time has come to embrace the situation and to look outside of conventional solutions with positivity and excitement. A complete and radical reassessment of our capabilities and opportunities. Thereâ€™s so much to look forward to.
>
> We have the tools and skills available to us to bring about massive positive change.
>
> Solving properly and sustainably our growing list of problems.
>
> Healthcare, poverty, crime, drugs, stress, infrastructure breakdown, climate change and pollution are readily solvable today. But we will need to approach these challenges in a different way now. This is the 21st century and we cannot use 19th century 'solutions' any more.
